# CSE 100: Algorithm Design and Analysis
Introduction to the design and analysis of computer algorithms. Topics include
analysis and implementation of algorithms, concepts of algorithm complexity, and various algorithmic design patterns. Course will also cover major algorithms and data structures for searching and sorting, graphs, and some optimization
techniques.

## Course Objectives

The course introduces the basics of computational complexity analysis and
various algorithm design paradigms. The goal is to provide students with solid
foundations to deal with a wide variety of computational problems, and to provide a thorough knowledge of the most common algorithms and data structures. Topics include analysis and implementation of algorithms, concepts of algorithm complexity, and various algorithmic design patterns. The course will also cover major algorithms and data structures for searching and sorting, graphs, and some optimization techniques. In addition to learning about all these different topics, by the end of the class, you should be able to model a computational problem, understand the trade-offs in the design of a solution, and be able to implement a software solution to the problem. In the overall picture of the CSE program, this is one of the few classes that will teach you foundational skills to develop solutions for computation problems and the skills to implement the solutions in software
